# Getting Started with React

This is the root of the Front End for the MERN template. 

## Front End dependencies

Install all Front End dependencies from here. For example:

```
npm install react-router
```

## Supply Express with a build directory
The Back End express server will be looking for a build directory and will complain if it doesn't find one. Although not necessaray, Run `npm run build` to silence that complaint.

```
npm run build
```
